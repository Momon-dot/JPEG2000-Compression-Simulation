# JPEG2000-Compression-Simulation
This is a simulation of JPEG200 Compression Process which consists of Image Color Space Conversion to YCbCr, Wavelet Transform, Scalar Quantization, and Aritmetic Encoding

All the processes mentioned above can be found in these python file respectively,

- backend.py for handling the overall processes for JPEG2000 Processes
- gui.py for GUI
- nt_toolbox for handling wavelet transforms 
- entropy_encode.py berisi for handling arithmetic encoding
- entropy_decode.py berisi for handling arithmetic decoding
- scalar_de_qua.py berisi for handling scalar quantization and de-quatization
